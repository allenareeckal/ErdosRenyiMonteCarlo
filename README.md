# ErdosRenyiMonteCarlo
ErdosRenyiMonteCarlo takes three command-line ar-
guments N, p, and T, and runs a Monte-Carlo simulation consisting of T
trials. Each trial generates a new undirected Erdos-Renyi graph with param-
eters N and p. Output the pdf of the degree distribution
averaged over all T trials (i.e., each pdf[i] is the number of nodes having de-
gree i averaged over T trials).
